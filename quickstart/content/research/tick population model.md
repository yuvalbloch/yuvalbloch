## Model

This model simulates tick population dynamics using a **3-layer lattice**, where each layer corresponds to a life stage: **larva**, **nymph**, and **adult**. Ticks move both **vertically** between life stages and **horizontally** between geographic locations by biting a host.

### Lattice and Tick Population

- Each land cell is denoted by $L_{i,j}$, with a tick-carrying capacity $K_{i,j}$.
    
- The population at life stage $s$ in cell $L_{i,j}$ is represented by $P_{i,j,s}$.

### Tick Movement and Life Cycle

To simplify, the model is first described in discrete steps:

At each time step:

- A fraction $R$ of ticks in stage $s$ (i.e., $P_{i,j,s}$) attempt to transition.
    
- A portion $Q(P_{i,j,s}, K_{i,j})$ of these successfully transition to stage $s+1$; the rest die.
    
- New positions are selected via a **movement kernel** $M(L_{x,y}, L_{i,j})$, defining the probability of moving to each neighboring cell.
    

If the biting tick is an adult ($s = 3$), it reproduces by laying eggs, producing new larvae.

### Differential Equations

The change in tick population at each life stage is modeled using the following differential equations:

#### For nymphs and adults ($s > 1$):
$$
dPi,j,sdt=∑(x,y)∈N(i,j)R⋅Px,y,s−1⋅Q(Pi,j,s−1,Ki,j)⋅M(Lx,y,Li,j)−R⋅Pi,j,s\frac{dP_{i,j,s}}{dt} = \sum_{(x,y) \in N(i,j)} R \cdot P_{x,y,s-1} \cdot Q(P_{i,j,s-1}, K_{i,j}) \cdot M(L_{x,y}, L_{i,j}) - R \cdot P_{i,j,s}
$$
#### For larvae ($s = 1$):
$$
dPi,j,1dt=∑(x,y)∈N(i,j)R⋅Px,y,3⋅Q(Pi,j,3,Ki,j)⋅M(Lx,y,Li,j)⋅E−R⋅Pi,j,1\frac{dP_{i,j,1}}{dt} = \sum_{(x,y) \in N(i,j)} R \cdot P_{x,y,3} \cdot Q(P_{i,j,3}, K_{i,j}) \cdot M(L_{x,y}, L_{i,j}) \cdot E - R \cdot P_{i,j,1}
$$

## Simulation Approach

The simulation uses a **stochastic agent-based model** based on the **Gillespie algorithm**, optimized via a decision tree (see Lester, 2020). Each agent represents a tick population at a specific stage and location.

### Simulation Steps

1. **Select Agent:** Each lattice cell is assigned an event rate of $P_{i,j,s} \cdot R$.
    
2. **Determine Event:**
    
    - Bite: $\frac{Q_{i,j,k}}{1 + Q_{i,j,k}}$
        
    - Death: $\frac{1}{1 + Q_{i,j,k}}$
        
3. **If bite occurs:**  
    Select destination based on movement kernel $M(L_{x,y}, L_{i,j})$.
    
4. **If adult bites:**  
    Lay eggs following a normal distribution around $E$.
    

### Infection Risk Estimation

Although the model does not explicitly include the **Rickettsia** pathogen, it assumes a $>$50% infection rate in the study area. Therefore, **human bites** are used as a **proxy for infection risk**, weighted by average tick density and human visitation per cell.
