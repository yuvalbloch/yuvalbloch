## Introduction

Ecological models often depend on parameters that are difficult to measure precisely. **Sensitivity analysis** helps us ask: _how much do these uncertainties matter?_ It allows us to explore:

- Which parameters most strongly influence model outcomes
    
- What combinations lead to persistence or extinction
    
- How robust the system is to changes in key assumptions
    

In this project, I go beyond simply measuring sensitivity. I use these tools to **map the boundary between viable and non-viable ecological conditions**‚Äîthe tipping points where tick populations either collapse or persist. By comparing these boundaries to patterns observed in real-world data, I can ask a deeper question: **which combinations of parameters are not just viable, but actually relevant to the system I'm trying to model?**

## Types of Sensitivity Analysis

Throughout this work, I use several types of sensitivity analysis, each suited to a specific goal:

### ‚ùå Local Sensitivity Analysis  
Changes one parameter at a time.  
**Not used** here‚Äîinteractions between parameters are too strong for this to be meaningful.

### üåç Regional Sensitivity Analysis  
Explores combinations of a few key parameters.  
Used to locate regions where ticks either survive or go extinct under plausible ecological assumptions.

### üåê Global Sensitivity Analysis  
Covers the full parameter space.  
Used to identify dominant parameters and how they interact across the entire model.

### üèû Structural Sensitivity Analysis  
Varies landscape structure instead of parameters.  
Used to test how spatial patterns (e.g. land use maps) affect tick dynamics.  
_Covered separately due to complexity._

## Using SVM to Define the Viable Parameter Space

The first task was to identify which combinations of ecological parameters allow **tick populations to persist**. I focused on three key ones:

- `k`: Carrying capacity  
- `d‚ÇÄ`: Death rate when ticks are rare  
- `d_c`: Death rate at carrying capacity  

I ran many simulations with randomly sampled values for these parameters, labeling the outcomes:

- `0`: Population went extinct  
- `1`: Population persisted  

To organize and generalize these results, I trained a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. Rather than just speeding things up, the SVM became central: it **learned the boundary** between survival and extinction and gave me a functional representation of the viable region in parameter space.

## Active Learning: Smarter Sampling

To improve the SVM with fewer simulations, I used **active learning**. The model identified parameter sets near the decision boundary‚Äîwhere it was most uncertain‚Äîand I focused simulations there.

I tried a few kernel functions and settled on a **polynomial kernel**, which captured the nonlinear shape of the viability boundary best.

## Beyond Viability: Exploring System Behavior

Once I mapped the viability zone, I looked more closely at **how** the model behaves across it. I used three summary statistics:

- **Proportion of occupied cells**  
- **Mean number of ticks per occupied cell**  
- **Overall average tick density**

Many parameter sets produced all-or-nothing results‚Äîeither nearly all cells were full or nearly all were empty. But real ecosystems aren‚Äôt so binary. I was looking for **mixed outcomes**: some patches full, others not. This is what I observed in field data and wanted the model to reflect.

## Parameter Insights

Looking across the viable space, several patterns became clear:

- **Increasing `d‚ÇÄ`** reduces both:
  - The proportion of occupied cells  
  - The average number of ticks per occupied cell  

- **Increasing `k`** has the opposite effect:
  - It raises both patch occupancy and tick density  

- The **difference between `d‚ÇÄ` and `d_c`** also matters:
  - A larger difference boosts the number of surviving patches  
  - But lowers the average tick count within them‚Äîpossibly due to early saturation

### What I‚Äôm Looking For



The real world is not homogeneous. Field data show **variation**‚Äîsome areas have ticks, others do not‚Äîand this pattern holds across different values of _k_. To reflect that, I searched for parameter sets that produced:

- **Heterogeneous landscapes** with partial tick occupancy
    
- **Moderate tick densities** that avoid unrealistic overpopulation
    

After testing many combinations, I identified one that struck a good balance. Tick populations persisted **in some** areas while remaining ecologically realistic, closely aligning with observed dynamics.

The final question I need to answer before applying this model to real land use scenarios is whether it responds only to **average carrying capacity**‚Äîor if it's also sensitive to the **structure of the landscape** itself. This matters because research shows that spatial structure can strongly influence tick populations, yet it‚Äôs much harder to capture in models.

In my next post, I‚Äôll explore this by using a beautiful mathematical concept: **fractal dimensionality**. I‚Äôll show how it reveals that the model isn‚Äôt just reacting to average conditions‚Äîit‚Äôs truly sensitive to the **spatial complexity** of the land.

üì¢ **Stay tuned**‚Äîit gets surprisingly elegant.
