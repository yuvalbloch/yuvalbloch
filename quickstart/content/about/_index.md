**I’m Yuval Bloch**, a computational ecologist and M.Sc. student in the Department of Life Sciences at **Ben-Gurion University of the Negev**, working in the **Ecological Complexity Lab** under the supervision of Dr. Shai Pilosoph.

My research focuses on applying computational tools to understand and model complex ecological systems. With a background in computer science and a strong interest in ecological theory, I integrate approaches from machine learning, network science, and spatial modeling to explore biodiversity, disease dynamics, and ecosystem resilience.



## Research Interests

- Ecological complexity and system dynamics
    
- Spatial and agent-based modeling of ecological systems
    
- Vector-borne disease modeling and risk prediction
    
- Conservation informatics and biodiversity analysis
    
- Interdisciplinary applications of computational tools in ecology

  ### Current Work

  I'm currently developing a computational model that simulates tick population dynamics in relation to land-use patterns and economic scenarios. This work is part of the **EEID Madagascar Project**, and aims to predict future disease risks under changing ecological and socio-economic conditions.

  ### Academic Background

  - **M.Sc. in Biology and Ecology**, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev  
    _2023 – Present_ | GPA: 95  

  - **B.Sc. in Computer Science**, The Open University of Israel  
    _2020 – 2023_ | GPA: 83
