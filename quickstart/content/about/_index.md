**Yuval Bloch** is a computational ecologist and M.Sc. student in the Department of Life Sciences at **Ben-Gurion University of the Negev**, working in the **Ecological Complexity Lab** under the supervision of Dr. Shai Pilosoph.

His research focuses on the application of computational tools to understand and model complex ecological systems. With a background in computer science and a strong interest in ecological theory, Yuval integrates approaches from machine learning, network science, and spatial modeling to address questions related to biodiversity, disease dynamics, and ecosystem resilience.

## Research Interests

- Ecological complexity and network dynamics  
- Spatial and agent-based modeling of ecological systems  
- Vector-borne disease modeling and risk prediction  
- Conservation informatics and biodiversity analysis  
- Interdisciplinary applications of machine learning in ecology

## Current Work

Yuval’s current research involves the development of a computational model that simulates tick population dynamics in relation to land-use patterns and economic scenarios. This work is conducted in collaboration with the **EEID Madagascar Project**, with the goal of predicting future disease risk under changing ecological and socio-economic conditions.
